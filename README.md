## Introduction

SEENOW is an innovative application designed to assist visually impaired users in understanding their surroundings through the power of AI-driven object recognition technology. Our solution leverages advanced machine learning models to verbally articulate the types of objects and their proximity within the user's environment, thereby enhancing their spatial awareness and navigation capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Recognition:** Fast and accurate identification of various objects in the user's vicinity.
- **Audio Descriptions:** Clear and concise verbal descriptions of the recognized objects.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** User-friendly design that is accessible and easy to navigate for visually impaired users.
- **Offline Functionality:** Core features are available without the need for an internet connection.
- **Multi-language Support:** Offers support for multiple languages to cater to a global user base.
